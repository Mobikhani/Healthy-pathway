# 🔧 iOS Build Troubleshooting Guide

## 🚨 **Error: "No files were found with the provided path: build/ios/ipa/*.ipa"**

### **What This Error Means:**
The GitHub Actions workflow couldn't find the IPA file in the expected location. This usually happens when:
1. The iOS build failed
2. The IPA file wasn't created properly
3. The file path is incorrect

### **✅ Solutions (In Order of Priority):**

#### **Solution 1: Check Build Logs**
1. Go to your GitHub repository → Actions tab
2. Click on the failed workflow run
3. Look for error messages in the build steps
4. Common issues:
   - Missing dependencies
   - Code signing issues
   - Flutter version conflicts

#### **Solution 2: Manual Build Trigger**
1. Go to Actions → "iOS Development Build"
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Choose "debug" build type
4. This creates a fresh build with better error reporting

#### **Solution 3: Check Flutter Version**
```bash
flutter --version
```
Make sure you're using Flutter 3.32.5 or later

#### **Solution 4: Clean and Rebuild**
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build ios --debug --no-codesign
```

#### **Solution 5: Verify iOS Setup**
1. Check if `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` exists
2. Verify `ios/Podfile` is present
3. Ensure all iOS dependencies are installed

### **🔍 Debugging Steps:**

#### **Step 1: Check Workflow Output**
- Look for "✅ IPA file created successfully" message
- If you see "❌ IPA file not found", the build failed

#### **Step 2: Verify File Structure**
The workflow expects:
```
ios/
├── build/
│   ├── ios/
│   │   └── HealthyPathway-iPhone12Pro-*.ipa
│   └── ios-dev/
│       └── HealthyPathway-iPhone12Pro-DEV-*.ipa
```

#### **Step 3: Check Build Artifacts**
- Go to Actions → Latest run → Artifacts
- You should see one IPA file with clear naming

### **🚀 Quick Fix Commands:**

If the build keeps failing, try these commands locally:
```bash
# Clean everything
flutter clean
flutter pub get

# Build for iOS (this will show detailed errors)
flutter build ios --debug --no-codesign

# Check if build succeeded
ls ios/build/ios/iphoneos/
```

### **📞 When to Get Help:**

Contact support if:
- Build fails consistently
- Error messages are unclear
- IPA file is created but won't install on iPhone 12 Pro

### **💡 Prevention Tips:**

1. **Always check the build logs** before downloading
2. **Use the development build** for testing (more stable)
3. **Keep Flutter updated** to latest stable version
4. **Test locally first** before pushing to GitHub
